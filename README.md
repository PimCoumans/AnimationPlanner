# AnimationPlanner

‚õì Chain multiple `UIView` animations without endlessly nesting in completion closures, but using a clear declarative syntax. Create all your animations in the same indentation level with a convenient API leveraging the magic of Swift result builders.
AnimationBuilder is used in most of the superfluous animations seen in the [OK Video](https://okvideo.app/download) app.

üìñ Read the [documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/PimCoumans/AnimationPlanner/main/documentation/animationplanner) to get you up to speed, or read on to see a little example.

## How do I do this?
üì¶ Add `AnimationPlanner` to your project (only SPM is currently officially supported) and start typing `AnimationPlanner.plan` to embark on your animation journey, like what‚Äòs happening in the code below.

```swift
AnimationPlanner.plan {
    Wait(0.35)
    Animate(duration: 0.32, timingFunction: .quintOut) {
        view.alpha = 1
        view.center.y = self.view.bounds.midY
    }
    Wait(0.2)
    Animate(duration: 0.32) {
        view.transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 2, y: 2)
        view.layer.cornerRadius = 40
        view.backgroundColor = .systemRed
    }.timingFunction(.quintOut)
    Wait(0.2)
    AnimateSpring(duration: 0.25, damping: 0.52) {
        view.backgroundColor = .systemBlue
        view.layer.cornerRadius = 0
        view.transform = .identity
    }
    Wait(0.58)
    Animate(duration: 0.2) {
        view.alpha = 0
        view.transform = .identity
        view.frame.origin.y = self.view.bounds.maxY
    }.timingFunction(.circIn)
} completion: { finished in
    view.removeFromSuperview()
}
```

The above code creates the following animation. For more examples see the Sample App available when cloning the repo.

_**Note:** The example shows usage of custom extension methods on `CAMediaTimingFunction` available in the framework_

## Installation

### üõ† Adding AnimationPlanner as a package dependency

1. Go to `File` -> `Add Packages`
3. Paste `https://github.com/PimCoumans/AnimationPlanner` in the search bar and click on "Add Package"
4. Select the target(s) in which you want to use AnimationPlanner

### üì¶ Swift Package Manager

Manually add AnimationPlanner as a package dependency in `package.swift`, by updating your package definition with: 

```swift
  dependencies: [
    .package(name: "AnimationPlanner", url: "https://github.com/PimCoumans/AnimationPlanner.git", .branch("main"))
  ],
```

And updating your target‚Äòs dependencies property with `dependencies: ["AnimationPlanner"]`

## üîÆ Future plans
 
While this API removes a lot of unwanted nesting in completion closures when using traditional `UIView.animate...` calls, a project is never finished and for future versions I have the following plans:
 - Cancel running animation sequences. Current idea is returning a `RunningAnimation` object with a `cancel()` method and information about the state of the animation sequence.
 - Remove usage of inaccurate `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` for manually adding delays where needed.
 - Tidy the API even more by using Swift‚Äòs builder pattern, like we see used in SwiftUI. In practice this would mean removing one more indent in your code! (Currently work in progress: see [Result builders](https://github.com/PimCoumans/AnimationPlanner/pull/10) to see what‚Äòs going on)
 - Maybe even allow this package to be used with SwiftUI? No idea how that would work.
