# AnimationPlanner

⛓ Chain multiple `UIView` animations without endlessly nesting in completion closures. Used in some of the more superfluous animations in the [OK Video](https://okvideo.app/download) app.
Very useful with @warpling‘s [`CAMediaTimingFunction` extensions](https://gist.github.com/warpling/21bef9059e47f5aad2f2955d48fd7c0c), giving you all the animation curves you need.

📖 Read the [documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/PimCoumans/AnimationPlanner/main/documentation/animationplanner) to get you up to speed, or read on on to see a little example.

## How do I do this?
📦 Add `AnimationPlanner` to your project (only SPM is currently officially supported) and use the `UIView.animateSteps()` method to start adding steps to the provided sequence, like shown below.

```swift
UIView.animateSteps { sequence in
    sequence
        .delay(0.35)
        .add(duration: 0.5, timingFunction: .quartOut) {
            view.alpha = 1
            view.center.y = self.view.bounds.midY
        }
        .delay(0.2)
        .add(duration: 0.32, timingFunction: .quintOut) {
            view.transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 2, y: 2)
            view.layer.cornerRadius = 40
            view.backgroundColor = .systemRed
        }
        .delay(0.2)
        .add(duration: 0.12, timingFunction: .backOut) {
            view.backgroundColor = .systemBlue
            view.layer.cornerRadius = 0
            view.transform = .identity
        }
        .delay(0.58)
        .add(duration: 0.2, timingFunction: .circIn) {
            view.alpha = 0
            view.transform = .identity
            view.frame.origin.y = self.view.bounds.maxY
        }
} completion: { finished in
    view.removeFromSuperview()
}
```

The above code creates the following animation. For more examples see the Sample App available when cloning the repo.

## Installation

### 🛠 Adding AnimationPlanner as a package dependency

1. Go to `File` -> `Add Packages`
3. Paste `https://github.com/PimCoumans/AnimationPlanner` in the search bar and click on "Add Package"
4. Select the target(s) in which you want to use AnimationPlanner

### 📦 Swift Package Manager

Manually add AnimationPlanner as a package dependency in `package.swift`, by updating your package definition with: 

```swift
  dependencies: [
    .package(name: "AnimationPlanner", url: "https://github.com/PimCoumans/AnimationPlanner.git", .branch("main"))
  ],
```

And updating your target‘s dependencies property with `dependencies: ["AnimationPlanner"]`

## 🔮 Future plans
 
While this API removes a lot of unwanted nesting in completion closures when using traditional `UIView.animate...` calls, a project is never finished and for future versions I have the following plans:
 - Cancel running animation sequences. Current idea is returning a `RunningAnimation` object with a `cancel()` method and information about the state of the animation sequence.
 - Remove usage of inaccurate `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` for manually adding delays where needed.
 - Tidy the API even more by using Swift‘s builder pattern, like we see used in SwiftUI. In practice this would mean removing one more indent in your code! (Currently work in progress: see [Result builders](https://github.com/PimCoumans/AnimationPlanner/pull/10) to see what‘s going on)
 - Maybe even allow this package to be used with SwiftUI? No idea how that would work.
