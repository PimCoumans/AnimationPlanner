/// (Used in making animation sequences without needing ``AnimationBuilder``)
/// This class is used to add steps to your animation sequence. When starting a sequence animation with `UIView.animateSteps(_:completion:)`, a sequence object is made available through the `addSteps` closure, From within this closure each step should be added to the sequence object.
///
/// Each method on ``AnimationSequence`` returns a reference to `Self`, enabling the use of chainging each method call.
///
/// Setting up your animation should be done with the following methods:
/// - ``delay(_:)`` adds a delay to the sequence. Delays are cumulative and are applied to the first actual animation to be performend.
/// -  ``add(duration:options:timingFunction:animations:)`` adds an animation step to the sequence, providing a specific duration and optionally the `UIView.AnimationOptions` options and a `CAMediaTimingFunction` timing function.
/// - ``addSpring(duration:delay:damping:initialVelocity:options:animations:)`` adds a spring-based animation step with the expected damping and velocity values.
/// - ``extra(_:)`` adds an ‘extra’ step to prepare state before or between steps for the next animation or perform side-effects like triggering haptic feedback.
/// - ``addGroup(with:)`` creates a ``Group`` object to which multiple animations can be added that should be performed simultaneously.
///
/// - Note: Each animation is created right before it needs to be executed, so referencing values changed in previous steps is possible.
